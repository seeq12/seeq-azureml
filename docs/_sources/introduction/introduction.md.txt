# Introduction

**seeq-azureml** provides an example framework that allows a data scientist working in Azure ML Studio and a plant
engineer or subject matter expert (SME) working in Seeq to collaborate and develop an effective, sustainable solution
for high value problems in manufacturing.

This python module integrates with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning (AML) models as a web service and can be installed
as a Seeq Add-on in Seeq Workbench. The plant engineer and/or SME interacts with the module through an easy to use UI
from which they can accomplish critical activities such as ad hoc/historical evaluations, model deployment in real time,
scaling to other assets, etc.

The Seeq Add-on is distributed as an example of a collaborative workflow between data scientists (model builders) and
plant engineers/SMEs (model consumers). Users are encouraged to fork the repo and make the necessary
modifications/enhancements that addresses the specific needs/workflows of their organization.
